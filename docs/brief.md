# WEBSITE DESIGN BRIEF
## Why Julian is the Best Fit for Molo

*A personal pitch website demonstrating alignment, commitment, and capability*

**Prepared for:** Sophie Bruce, Founder & CEO, Molo  
**Prepared by:** Julian Harris  
**Date:** 19 January 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This design brief outlines the strategic vision, content architecture, and creative direction for a bespoke website titled "Why Julian is the Best Fit for Molo". The site serves as a compelling, evidence-based pitch demonstrating Julian Harris's unique qualifications for the Product Manager role at Molo.

**Core Objective:** Create a memorable, professionally designed single-page (or multi-section) website that tells the story of why Julian's specific combination of skills, experience, and values makes him the ideal candidate to take Molo from prototype to production.

**Target Audience:** Sophie Bruce (Founder/CEO), Pippa Topp (Advisor/CPO), and any other stakeholders involved in the hiring decision.

**Key Differentiator:** This isn't just a CV or portfolio—it's a demonstration of the very skills Julian would bring to Molo: strategic thinking, user-centred design, clear communication, and the ability to translate complexity into clarity.

---

## 2. Strategic Context

### 2.1 Understanding Molo's Mission

Molo is building an AI-powered "Chief Household Officer"—a virtual assistant designed to reduce the mental load for working parents. The product addresses a genuine pain point backed by compelling data:

| Statistic | Insight |
|-----------|---------|
| 81% of mums have experienced burnout | Massive market pain point |
| ~20 hours/week spent on family planning | Quantifiable time savings opportunity |
| 1 in 10 women left workforce (2023) | B2B2C corporate wellness angle |
| Parenting declared public health crisis | Societal urgency & mission alignment |

### 2.2 What Molo Needs Right Now

Based on Sophie's conversation with Julian (19 Jan 2026) and Pippa's original brief, Molo needs:

1. **Hands-on pragmatism:** Someone who can "roll up their sleeves" and get things done—not a strategic advisor who stays at 30,000 feet.

2. **Prototype-to-production expertise:** Taking the MVP from launch (Spring 2026) through growth phase.

3. **Product roadmap leadership:** Sophie expressed concern about the product becoming "a house that's been extended and doesn't make sense" with features bolted on haphazardly.

4. **Prioritisation frameworks:** "Working out what to do, what order to do them in, and ultimately what we're working towards."

5. **UX excellence:** "This has to be really strong from a product point of view" because consumer products require emotional resonance, not just functional utility.

6. **Part-time capacity:** Initially ~50% commitment, which aligns with Julian's current availability following CReDO.

### 2.3 Competition Analysis

Sophie mentioned speaking to "two other people" over the following week. This website needs to clearly differentiate Julian from potentially impressive competitors by demonstrating:

- **Deep domain alignment:** Personal experience with parenting, "baby brain", sleep deprivation
- **Technical credibility:** Not just product—actual AI engineering experience
- **Startup battle scars:** Founder experience including a documented post-mortem (Knowcast)
- **Recent proof points:** CReDO turnaround delivered just weeks ago (Dec 2025)

---

## 3. Content Architecture

The website should flow as a narrative that builds conviction progressively. Below is the recommended structure with source materials for each section.

### 3.1 Hero Section: "I Get It"

**Purpose:** Establish immediate emotional connection and demonstrate personal understanding of the problem Molo solves.

#### Key Messages:
- Father of two boys (ages 11 and 15)—lived through the chaos Molo is solving
- Personal anecdote from conversation: *"They're saying that extended sleep deprivation has symptoms akin to early Alzheimer's... I remember my short-term memory was so shot at points because of terrible extended sleep deprivation, so I can literally feel the pain of the situation you're talking about."*
- 54 years old but in "better shape than in my 40s"—mirrors Sophie's comment about age expectations shifting

#### Design Direction:
- Full-bleed hero image or background animation (perhaps subtle particles representing "mental load" being cleared)
- Large, confident headline: something like "I don't just understand the mental load—I've lived it."
- Immediate credibility badge: "Father. Engineer. Product Leader. Ready to help Molo change parenting forever."

---

### 3.2 The Alignment Matrix

**Purpose:** Demonstrate systematic, evidence-based fit between what Molo needs and what Julian offers.

#### Content Structure (Interactive Table or Cards):

| MOLO NEEDS | JULIAN BRINGS | EVIDENCE |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| Hands-on PM who ships | 25+ years shipping products from idea to multi-release | CReDO MVP Dec 2025, Google Pitch Now (15,000 users), Friends Provident (11 awards) |
| AI/Agentic expertise | Deep AI engineering + building AI agents daily | Ceetrix (AI delivery mgmt), Making AI Agents newsletter, 15+ AI prototypes in 2024-25 |
| Consumer UX excellence | UX researcher & designer background, understands emotional products | Designed all UX for Google's flagship product; "It doesn't test well" as the ultimate defence |
| Startup mentality | Founded companies, advised early-stage startups, written post-mortems | Knowcast (founder), Earthly, Inicio, PageMind advisory roles |
| Turnaround capability | Track record of entering chaos and creating order | CReDO: 5 orgs, 4 cities → delivered MVP; CognitionX: 6 months of nothing → weekly delivery |
| Part-time availability | Currently at 50% capacity, looking for meaningful engagement | CReDO winding down Q1 2026; timeline aligns perfectly with Molo Spring launch |

---

### 3.3 Case Study Deep-Dive: CReDO

**Purpose:** Provide irrefutable, recent evidence of product leadership excellence.

#### Story Arc:

**1. THE SITUATION**  
Month 8 of a 12-month £10m climate infrastructure project. Five organisations across four UK cities. Three product managers who couldn't answer basic questions like "How does your work relate to priorities?"

**2. THE INTERVENTION**  
Julian parachuted in to provide missing product leadership and UX direction.

**3. THE ACTIONS**
- Created cross-disciplinary "build team" with 6 components and biweekly sprints
- Embedded an "Ambassador User" (UKPN energy strategist) for real-time domain expertise
- Built 15-page "Master PRD" consolidating dozens of scattered documents
- Introduced OKRs for consistent reporting
- Mentored Junior PM and Scrum Master from scratch

**4. THE RESULTS**

> *"Music to my ears... I'm so impressed with the professionalism of the team... I actually understand the Jira backlog now."*  
> — UKPN Executive Sponsor

- MVP delivered ready for UAT on December 19, 2025—as promised
- New functionality delivered every two weeks aligned with user needs
- Five organisations now operating as one aligned product team

#### Why This Matters for Molo:
Sophie needs someone who can take a nascent product organisation and give it structure, clarity, and momentum—without making it bureaucratic. CReDO proves Julian does exactly that.

---

### 3.4 Philosophy & Frameworks

**Purpose:** Demonstrate intellectual depth and shared values with Sophie's psychological approach.

#### Key Talking Points from the Conversation:

- **"User experience is competitive advantage"** — Julian was advocating this in the 1990s, before UX was mainstream
- **Decision fatigue and cognitive load** — natural alignment with Sophie's sports psychology background
- **"The egg" framework for scoping** — hard shell on boundaries, flexible yolk on details (exactly what Molo needs)
- **Van Westendorp willingness-to-pay framework** for pricing research
- **"Write It" framework** for laser-focused early customer targeting
- **Consumer products are emotional decisions** — technical quality is necessary but not sufficient

#### Design Opportunity:
Consider an interactive "Philosophy Cards" section where hovering/clicking reveals Julian's thoughts on key product topics: prioritisation, user research, go-to-market, pricing, etc.

---

### 3.5 The Technical Edge

**Purpose:** Differentiate from pure-play product managers who lack technical depth.

#### Evidence Points:
- Started career as software engineer; worked hands-on for 20+ years
- Currently building Ceetrix: AI delivery management system for coding agents
- Python, TypeScript, Rust proficiency (not just conversational knowledge)
- Created in-appagents.com domain in anticipation of conversational AI becoming table stakes
- Deep understanding of AI agent architectures, prompt engineering, LLM capabilities and limitations
- Machine learning experience dating back to early 2000s (Friends Provident real-time underwriting)

#### Why This Matters for Molo:
Molo is building with "Agentic AI to actually execute on your behalf." Julian isn't just comfortable with this technology—he's building it himself daily. He can have meaningful technical conversations with developers, evaluate AI vendor claims critically, and spot opportunities to leverage emerging capabilities.

#### Quote from conversation:

> *"My side hustle is working on this other project where I'm building it all myself. And it's trying to solve the problem of how do you keep these agents disciplined? How do you, when you get code generated, how do you know that it's doing what you asked it to do?"*  
> — Julian Harris

### 3.6 The Portfolio Timeline

**Purpose:** Visual credibility through breadth and depth of experience.

#### Suggested Format:
Interactive horizontal timeline showing 25+ years of products shipped, with key milestones clickable for details.

#### Highlighted Projects (from CV):

| Period | Product | Role | Impact |
|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2025 | CReDO | Senior Product Manager | Turnaround; MVP on time |
| 2024-25 | Ceetrix | Founder | AI coding agent guardrails |
| 2021-22 | Knowcast | Founder | Voice-first learning app |
| 2017-18 | CognitionX | PM, Tech Lead | Team turnaround |
| 2012-14 | Google Pitch Now | PM, UX Designer | 15,000 sales staff users |
| 2003-06 | Friends Provident eSelect | Engineer, Tech Lead | 11 industry awards |

Full portfolio includes 30+ products across B2C, B2B, internal tools, and APIs.

### 3.7 Call to Action

**Purpose:** Clear next step with low friction.

#### Content:
- Reaffirm enthusiasm: "I'm genuinely excited about what Molo is building."
- Acknowledge process: "I know you're speaking with others this week."
- Make it easy: Direct calendar link for follow-up conversation
- Offer value: "Happy to share more thoughts on product roadmap priorities, go-to-market approaches, or anything else useful"

## 4. Design Direction

### 4.1 Overall Aesthetic

The visual design should communicate: professional yet warm, structured yet human, technically sophisticated yet approachable. This mirrors the ideal product leader for Molo—someone who brings rigour without rigidity.

#### Recommended Direction: "Editorial Warmth"
- Clean, magazine-quality typography (not sterile corporate)
- Generous whitespace balanced with thoughtful density in evidence sections
- Subtle warmth in colour palette—avoiding cold tech blues
- Moments of personality and wit (Julian mentioned badminton, extreme sports)
- Micro-interactions that feel polished but not flashy

### 4.2 Colour Palette

| Role | Colour | Hex | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----|-----------|
| Primary | Deep Navy | `#1E3A5F` | Conveys reliability and professionalism |
| Secondary | Warm Teal | `#2A9D8F` | Nods to Molo's brand while remaining distinct |
| Accent | Soft Coral | `#E76F51` | Warmth, energy, parenting/family resonance |
| Neutrals | Warm Greys | `#6B7280` | Avoids clinical feel |
| Background | Light Cream | `#FEFCF3` | Comfortable reading experience |

### 4.3 Typography

| Use | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-----|----------------|-----------|
| Headlines | Serif (Playfair Display, Libre Baskerville) | Editorial authority |
| Body | Clean sans-serif (Source Sans Pro, IBM Plex Sans) | Readability |
| Accents | Monospace | Subtle nod to engineering background |

### 4.4 Imagery & Graphics

- **Avoid:** Stock photos of generic "professionals" or "happy families"
- **Consider:** Abstract data visualisation elements, timeline graphics, iconography
- **If photos are used:** Candid, natural shots rather than posed portraits
- **Opportunity:** Custom illustrations representing key concepts (mental load, product development lifecycle, etc.)

### 4.5 Animation & Interaction

- Scroll-triggered reveals for content sections
- Subtle hover states on cards and links
- Timeline could animate on scroll
- Consider: Typing animation for key quotes
- **Avoid:** Anything that slows down page load or feels gimmicky

---

## 5. Technical Specifications

### 5.1 Platform Recommendation

Given Julian's technical capabilities and the need for rapid deployment:

- **Primary option:** Single-page React/Next.js site deployed on Vercel
- **Alternative:** Static HTML/CSS/JS if simpler maintenance desired
- **Domain:** Consider `whyjulianformolo.com` or `julian-molo.com`

### 5.2 Performance Requirements

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Page load | <2 seconds on 3G connection |
| Responsive | Mobile-first (Sophie may view on phone) |
| Lighthouse score | 90+ across all metrics |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance |

### 5.3 Analytics

- Basic page view tracking (how long did Sophie spend on each section?)
- Click tracking on key elements (calendar link, project cards)
- Consider: Session recording (Hotjar) for heatmap insights

## Appendix A: Full CReDO Case Study

*(Included for reference — this content can be expanded on the website)*

### Background

CReDO is funded as part of a £10m Ofgem innovation fund. The goal is to help UK infrastructure (power, water, and other utilities) better plan for increasingly extreme climate events by running cross-sector simulations.

### The State When Julian Joined

Six months into the project, Connected Places Catapult identified two skill gaps: user experience design and product leadership. At month 8, Julian joined along with a UX design agency. That meant five companies working across four cities in the UK.

Coming into it, basic questions were very hard to answer:
- How does the work being done link to the requirements we've committed to?
- How do teams decide what work to do and when?
- How do we coordinate work across different areas?
- How do we know we're designing the right things?
- How do we know we're building the right features technically?

### Interventions Made

- Structures put in place to clarify expectations and responsibilities
- Onboarded an Ambassador User (UKPN energy asset strategist) for domain expertise on tap
- Designed cross-disciplinary "build team" with 6 components and biweekly sprints
- Introduced OKRs for consistent reporting
- Bootstrapped Junior PM and Scrum Master roles from scratch
- Created concise 15-page "Master PRD" consolidating dozens of sources
- Rigorous roadmapping to manage time, quality, and features

### Results

- UKPN exec sponsor: "Music to my ears" / "I'm so impressed with the professionalism"
- Team delivered new functionality every two weeks aligned with user needs
- Vastly more reliable upward communication
- MVP delivered ready for UAT as promised December 19, 2025
